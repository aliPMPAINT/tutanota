The server only needs a fingerprint (hash) of your password. With Tutanota your hash for authentication is calculated by your browser and only the hash is being sent. Your password never travels the Internet in plain text and it is never seen by our server. As hashes are non-invertible, the server is unable to reconstruct your password from the hash. The server is not able to decrypt your message, but still able to log you in.Recommended for further reading:&nbsp;<a href=\"/blog/posts/innovative-encryption\">Learn how Tutanota automates the encryption process while leaving you in full control of your encrypted data</a>.",

These standards do not support forward secrecy and are not resistant to attacks from quantum computers. In addition, it is important to us that the subject line in emails is also encrypted. That's why we have developed a solution that is also based on recognized algorithms (RSA and AES) and that automatically encrypts the subject, the content and the attachments. In the future, we plan to upgrade these algorithms to quantum-resistant ones that also support forward secrecy. <a href=\"/blog/posts/innovative-encryption\">You can find more information on why Tutanota does not use PGP here</a>.We also see the importance that Tutanota needs to be interoperable with other encryption solutions.
